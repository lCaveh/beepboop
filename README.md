## Description

_In this program I used Javascript and jQuery to get a number from user. Then create an array of integers from 0 to that number. Then added some condition to find and change every number contains 0 with Beep!,every number contains 1 with Boop!, and every number that is divisible by 3 to a text. And finally shows the elements to use forward or backward depends on the user's selection. To do this I used a callback function and put it into interval to show each element in one second._
